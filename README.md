A people counting device placed in doorways.

Amid the coronavirus crisis it has been more important than ever to accurately determine how many people are in a space.
This project aims to count the indiviudals entering a builiding or room. It does so by connecting a raspberry pi to two Ultra-Sound sensors.
Then code is written in python to constantly determine the distance between the sensors and therefore calculate if a person passes the doorway.
The direction is also determined depending on whether sensor A is triggered before sensor B or vice versa.
